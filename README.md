Welcome to the Galactic Odyssey game repository!
During Pura Game Jam '24, my team and I developed 'Galactic Odyssey' in just 48 hours using Unity and C#. After the theme “Space” was announced, we brainstormed and refined our ideas, leading to late-night coding sessions to sculpt game mechanics, design levels and perfect details. The game features a robust physics system for responsive spaceship controls and precise collision detection.

- Game objective is to reach the end and find a habitable planet.
- This is achieved by going through 2 minigames and 2 different planet platform-game levels.

## Level 1
This level makes the player go through the green planet. This planet might seem friendly at first but the strong wind and toxic rain make it unhabitable. So our player has to keep on exploring the space.

## Level 2
This desert planet is our player's second destination. This planet has strong UV lights that burn your skin when exposed too long. Player needs to use the clouds to quickly get to their spaceship and leave.

## Minigame
While our player goes from planet to planet, there are asteroids they have to avoid. With the shooting mechanic, they can destroy these asteroids and move on to their destination.
